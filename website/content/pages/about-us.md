This is the result of an advanced practical at the [robotics lab Heidelberg](http://roboter.uni-hd.de),
accomplished in the summer semester 2017.
Its goal was the implementation of a game on a microcontroller-based game console.

# Project Evolution
The practical began in May 2017 and ended in September.
Until mid-July, we familiarized with Atmega programming and decided on a [game](game-idea.html).
Then, we [implemented](implementation.html) a first basic version until the end of July,
which was refined in August.
Finally, we added [sound effects and background music](sound.html) in September.
