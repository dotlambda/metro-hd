We based our game on the Metroid Series, especially on Metroid Fusion which is an action-adventure jump'n'run game.

So what is there to do in our game?

![Fight against various Monster.](images/world2.png){width=50%}

There are no less than 8 monster types in our game. The protagonist faces at least one of them in each room and can kill them with his rockets or one of his bombs.

Additionally there are different obstacles like water or spikes in the different levels.

![Rest in the Recharge Room.](images/world4.png){width=50%}

Before every fifth level, there is a so called recharge room, where the protagonist can refill his energy and ammunition.

![Fight bosses.](images/world6.png){width=50%}

After the recharge room there will be a boss encounter in which one of the four bosses appear.
All the bosses have different moves and abilities, so none is like the other.

![Achieve Power-Ups.](images/world5.png){width=50%}

After successfully defeating a boss the protagonist obstains a Power-Up.

The amount of monsters which can appear in one room will increase by one after each successful boss fight.
