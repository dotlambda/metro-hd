# About
This is the result of an advanced practical at the [robotics lab Heidelberg](http://roboter.uni-hd.de),
accomplished in the summer semester 2017.
Its goal was the implementation of a game on a microcontroller-based game console.

You can read more about it on the [website](http://joanna.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/projects/2017SS_SPIELEKONSOLE_B/).
Also take a look at our
[presentation slides](http://joanna.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/projects/2017SS_SPIELEKONSOLE_B/downloads/slides.pdf)
(in German).

# Setup
If you are a [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) user,
you can use the provided `shell.nix` to get an environment with
every package you need to compile and upload the code to the console,
to generate the C arrays for sprites and music and
to compile the website using [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/).
